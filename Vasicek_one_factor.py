def generate_weiner_process(T: int = 1, dt: float = 0.001, rho: float = None) -> Any:
    # GENERATE_WEINER_PROCESS calculates the sample paths of a one-dimensional Brownian motion or a two-dimensional Brownian motion with a correlation coefficient of rho.
    # The function's output are two sample paths (realisations) of such a process, recorded on increments specified by dt. 
    # W = generate_weiner_process(T, dt, rho)
    #
    # Arguments:   
    #   T    = integer, specifying the maximum modeling time. ex. if T = 2 then modelling time will run from 0 to 2
    #   dt   = float, specifying the length of each subinterval. ex. dt=10, then there will be 10 intervals of length 0.1 between two integers of modeling time 
    #   rho  = float, specifying the correlation coefficient of the Brownian motion. ex. rho = 0.4 means that two 
    #          Brownian procesess on the same modeling time interval have a correlation coefficient of 0.4. SOURCE
    #
    # Returns:
    #   W =  N x 1 or N x 2 ndarray, where N is the number of subintervals, and the second dimension is eiter 1 or 2 depending if the function is called 
    #        to generate a one or two dimensional Brownian motion. Each column represents a sample path of a Brownian motion starting at x0 
    #
    # Example:
    # The user wants to generate discreete sample paths of two Brownian motions with a correlation coefficient of 0.4. 
    #    The Brownian motions needs to start at 0 at time 0 and on for 3 units of time with an increment of 0.5.
